## E-Commerce Backend (Object-Relational Mapping)


## Description
This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. It uses Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays the use of posting and getting routes. Then demonstrates the use of API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.
